Newtonâ€™s Three Laws of Motion describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting on it. The first law states that a body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon. The second law relates force to mass and acceleration (F = ma). The third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
